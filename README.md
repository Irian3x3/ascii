# ASCII
This repository is a code for an ASCII command (convert text into ASCII), made in [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/# "Discord.js")
## Note: You'll have to change some parts of the code if you use a different command handler.
## [The code is in ascii.js](./ascii.js "hi")
If you have any issues then obviously, create an issue
